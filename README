Insane Patcher

Created per request from my friends, this patcher will insanely, inefficiently and brutally fix various annoying stuff that modpack creator encountered with.

Targeting 1.7.10 only.

Compile and run with Java 8.

Feature list:
* Modular - use JavaScripts to control (almost) everything
* Slow - non-configurable.
* Also fix the bug of "repairing" ThermalExpansion stuff which yield into creative-only stuff
