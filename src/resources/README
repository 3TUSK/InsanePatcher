Simple documentation about this insane scripting system

You may already noticed that this mod makes use of JavaScript as a scripting language.
And yes, this mod is powered by Nashorn.

So yah, the workflow of this insane class transformer looks like following:

Trigger transformer -> Check class name -> Transform the class on needed -> ??? -> Profit

The workflow is managed by the mod on its own.
For those who want tobe insane and write scripts, they just need to the following:

  0. Make sure you know what you are going to do. Avoid using class transformer as much as possible
  1. Check if there is a folder named "insane_patchers" at their game directory.
     The exact location depends on launcher choices, but usually it is named "minecraft" or ".minecraft".
  2. Open it; or create it if not found.
  3. Open a file named target.properties; or create it if not found.
  4. As the extension name indicated, this is Java properties file.
     One line per entry.
     The key is the canonical name of the class you want to transform; value is the name of corresponding script file.
     Example:
     `info.tritusk.insanepatcher.InsaneClass=insane.js`
     which will tell this mod to use "insane.js" to transform the class "info.tritusk.insanepatcher.InsaneClass"
     (of neither the script nor class really exist)
  5. Specification of the scripts:
      1. Pre-defined variable "node" represents the ClassNode (org.objectweb.asm.tree.ClassNode)
      2. You may access any Java class upon this point; while you must access them with their full, canonical name.

This documentation is still a work-in-progress.
